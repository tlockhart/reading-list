# Goal
The goal of this project is to create and deploy a MERN application, consisting of a server and a Single Page Application (SPA), using React. The server stores and retrieves data from our API using MongoDB and displays content to the client, via the UI. The UI is broken into React components, that manage and transfer state, and responds to user events.
